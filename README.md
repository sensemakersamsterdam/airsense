# Airsense

Repository for Airsense, code and stuff to measure air quality in the city and at home.

Code in arduinos C++ and in micropython. There is a simple arduino application to test the particulate sensor. There is an application to run a sensor which stays on a location and uses http to transfer its data. And there is an application intended for mobile use which uses TheThings to transfer measurement data.
Data is sent to the Sensemakers platform.

The wiki gives information and links abouts sensors and air quality projects.
