# Airsense

Repository for Airsense, code and stuff to measure air quality in the city and at home.

Code in arduinos C++ and in micropython. There is a simple arduino application to test the particulate sensor. There is an application to run a sensor which stays on a location and uses http to transfer its data. And there is an application intended for mobile use which uses TheThings to transfer measurement data.
Data is sent to [[https://mijnomgeving.net/]]

The wiki gives information and links abouts sensors and air quality projects.
