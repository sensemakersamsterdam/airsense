Arduino files to read a dust sensor.
* Simpelstof is basic arduino. It runs on an Arduino Uno (and pretty much all ather boards). You can use this to test the sensor and as a basis for more functional code.
* Websense is written for an ESP8266 with wifi. It runs a webserver which shows the sensor values and hase some (very limited) sensorthings functionality. 
* Lorasense (to be done) takes measurements and sends these over TheThings network. Includes stuff to handle the messages on TheThings. Written for a TheThings Uno to keep it simple.
